Every fifth word capitalised: 
Now is the winter OF our discontent Made glorious SUMMER by this sun of YORK; And all the clouds THAT lour'd upon our house IN the deep bosom of THE ocean buried. Now are OUR brows bound with victorious WREATHS; Our bruised arms hung UP for monuments; Our stern ALARUMS changed to merry meetings, OUR dreadful marches to delightful MEASURES. Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd HIS wrinkled front; And now, INSTEAD of mounting barded steeds TO fright the souls of FEARFUL adversaries, He capers nimbly IN a lady's chamber To THE lascivious pleasing of a LUTE. But I, that am NOT shaped for sportive tricks, NOR made to court an AMOROUS looking-glass; I, that am RUDELY stamp'd, and want love's MAJESTY To strut before a WANTON ambling nymph; I, that AM curtail'd of this fair PROPORTION, racecar
