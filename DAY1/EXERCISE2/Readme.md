Day 1:
Exercise 2:
Program to read a CSV (CSV with n number of columns) and store it in DICT of list.

Languange -- Python3

Algorithm:
1.We read the input csv file and split them based on "\n" and store all lines to a list.
2.Since first line is headings, we store the headings into a list.
3.We iterate through the rest of the lines and we add the column value with their respective heading to a dictionary during each iteration and add the dictionary to a list.
4.Finally we print all the records in the list.

Thus the program reads the csv file and store it to a list of dictionary.
