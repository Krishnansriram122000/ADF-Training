Day 1:
Exercise 5:
Program to Convert Decimal to Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal

Languange -- Python3

Algorithm:
1. We create a function that accepts a decimal number and the base it has to be converted as it parameters.
2. We create an empty string to hold the result.
3. Each time the number is divided by the base and the remainder is added to the string, this is done until the number becomes 0.
4. For the remainders between 0 to 9, they are stored as numbers; But for the hexadecimal, the remainder between 10 to 15 are stored as alphabets A to F.
5. Then the string is printed and returned in reverse.
