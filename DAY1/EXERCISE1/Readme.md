Day 1:
Exercise 1:
Program to read a file and store the unique words in a list sorted based on the length of word in a new file along with each word length appended to it.

Languange -- Python3

Algorithm:
1.We are open the file that has data in it and reading the data and storing each word into list using the split() function in python.
2.Then we are updating the list by removing the repeated words.
3.The word lengths of all unique words are calculated and stored into a list.
4.Then we sort the words based on the wordlengths using bubble sort algorithm.
5.Then we open the outputfile and write each word and their count to it.

Thus the program writes the words with their count into the output file.
